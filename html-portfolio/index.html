    <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Brigham Andersen</strong>.  I'm a student at Brigham Young University getting a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science: Software Engineering and minoring in Business.
    <br />
    <br />
    I love solving the problem we hate most -- wasting time and money. <br />This passion drives my career, centered on using technology to boost business productivity. <br />Looking forward to using my skills in software engineering and business to help you! </p>  </div>
